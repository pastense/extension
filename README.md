- With the [FastAPI service](https://github.com/pastense/fastapi) running, enter your OpenAI API key into the form at `https://127.0.0.1:8000` (don't worry, it's stored locally!) 

## Next Steps
Once installed, Pastense will automatically log and embed your browsing data locally.  
You can search semantically through your history via the UI served by the FastAPI service.
